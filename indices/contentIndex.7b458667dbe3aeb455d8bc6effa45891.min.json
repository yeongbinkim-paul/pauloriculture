Inmon also says that a data warehouse should be time-variant, meaning that all data can be identified in a specific time interval, and non-volatile, meaning that data can be added but not erased to maintain a consistent purpose.\n\nThis data warehouse is defined in its most general scope, so there is a difference between that and the data warehouses that do the job nowadays.\nThis is because today's data warehouses are complete with many other external factors, including the purpose of the data and the cost of storing and processing it.\n\nI will talk about some things that can be added to this definition that are important to consider when designing and building a data warehouse.\n\n## Domain knowledge for Designing a Data Warehouse\nDomain knowledge is critical because data engineers should work with data based on well-developed logic.\nIf data engineers have a background in where the data is being used, they can distinguish the correlation and causation of each piece of data. If not, this will not be treating the data based on logic. It will be data processing to make it look good and will not serve any purpose.\nThat's why as a data engineer, you must have good domain knowledge and try to understand all of the data you're dealing with, in what form it exists, and how it's used.\n\nWhile this may seem like a similar perspective to domain-driven design, it's a little different.\nIt's well known that you can achieve high productivity, low complexity, and easy communication by adopting a domain-driven design in general. A data warehouse with domain knowledge can achieve various performance optimizations that best reflect the current data characteristics while keeping the data as usable as possible.\n\n\n## Demand forecasting in the data warehouse design process\nIf there is one remaining challenge for data engineers with good domain knowledge, it's demand forecasting.\nDemand forecasting refers to forecasting the demand for data that consumers will frequently use in the data warehouse for analytical purposes and preparing that data in a usable form.\n\nIn creating a data product, you must draw insights from multiple data points. As a data engineer, you work closest to the data sources, so you have the first access to this data and can easily do the most basic analysis.\nMost data is multidimensional, meaning that the same data can be separated into multiple dimensions and used for analysis. When dealing with multidimensional data, you must analyze multiple dimensions to see correlations.\nHowever, not all correlations lead to meaningful causal analysis, so data engineers must have many conversations with consumers who use the data they create.\n\n*Often, the consumers, in this case, will be people in cross-functional roles, such as data analysts, backend engineers, project managers, and product managers. These people have the same goal: to work with data, so they should have a broad understanding of a well-defined goal.*\n\nThen you should get ideas of how your data pipeline stores data and how it should be updated.\n\n## If I create a data warehouse architecture,\nAs described above, we believe that a data engineer should have a well-rounded understanding of the data first and foremost, based on well-developed domain knowledge, so that they can understand the consumer's needs and then design the data warehouse architecture accordingly.\nFollow this process carefully to save time refactoring your data warehouse architecture to respond to different data demands and changing your data schema occasionally.\n\nSo, if I were designing a data warehouse architecture from scratch, here's what I would consider.\n\n### 1. Understand as much as you can about the data you have right now.\nData architectures designed without fully understanding the data on your desk are short-lived. As I said above, you need to take the time to understand the data you have and what you need to accomplish by communicating with the consumers of that data.\n\n### 2. Determine what you must accomplish first and how you will get there.\nEvery data architecture has a business feasibility and a concise, maintainable architecture that considers all possibilities doesn't exist in the real world. First and foremost, you need to consider how you can accomplish what you need to complete, and in doing so, adopt the easiest and least expensive tech spec and implementation possible because the business logic will inevitably become more complex.\n\nHere are some of the things I like to consider during this process\n\n#### Requirements from the consumer perspective:\n\nPlease communicate with the data analysts and backend engineers who will consume the output of your data pipeline to understand their requirements. There should be an agreement on the information that must be included, the data format, and the frequency of data updates. This could take the form of an SLA. Ideally, if you're looking for a flawless implementation, you should be able to break down achievable goals with business feasibility, calculate a timeline, and get the work done.\n\n#### Selecting tech specs:\n\nYou need to select a tech spec for the implementation, which includes:\n\n1. the data infrastructure architecture\n\n2. the technical familiarity of the team members with the data infrastructure\n\n3. a weekly/monthly cost estimate for the data infrastructure\n\n4. a time estimate for the implementation.\n\nThe problem is that all the factors are highly uncertain, and it's hard to determine the order of importance. This is because the problem you're trying to solve looks different for every team in every company.\n\nI think the first thing to do in this situation is to do a Pre-Mortem with your team.\nIn his book 'Thinking, Fast and Slow', Daniel Kahneman refers to the concept of the planning fallacy, stating that many people become overconfident and fail to carry out their plans by creating unrealistic best-case scenarios or ignoring outside perspectives to find examples of similar situations.\nTo address the optimism that causes it, he suggests Pre-Mortem. Applying this concept to our problem, we can proceed as follows.\n\n1. Get together with your team and explain why this tech spec will fail miserably in 1, 3, or 6 months.\n\n2. For each reason for failure, identify ways to prevent it in the planning process.\n\n3. Briefly explore external examples that address each reason for failure.\n\nThese steps can prevent the team from collectively conforming to a decision and allow knowledgeable people to use their imaginations to identify risks in a desirable direction.\nIf you go through this process and then go back and select a tech spec that best satisfies the four considerations above, you will have a much more reliable tech spec.\n\n### 3. Plan your data stages.\nFor each stage, you need to define the purpose of the executed ETL jobs and the resulting data's role.\n\nFor example, one way to plan is to divide the stages into DATA LAKE, where data sources are loaded; DATA WAREHOUSE, which contains processed data; and DATA MART, which the consumers will use for actual products or analytics. The clearer the role of the pipe that processes data in each stage, the better it will be to identify improvement points when improving the structure in the future.\n\nHere's the guiding principle\n\n1. Rules for Storing data:\n\n    Each stage should have clear rules for storing data. For example, not all stages need to be non-volatile, but Source must be non-volatile.\n\n2. Rules for categorizing data:\n\n    Make sure you have clear rules for categorizing data in each stage. For example, the nature of data in a DATA MART can be data with new information generated from multiple data sources or data that has a clearly defined use outside of the pipeline. Be clear about the rationale for categorizing and storing data in each stage.\n\n3. Rules for processing data:\n\n    Make sure you have clear rules for processing data in each stage. For example, a pipeline that processes data in the stage before the DATA MART can enforce logic that guarantees equality. Or, when processing data in the data lake, you can enforce rules that only allow changing data type or column name.\n\n4. Rules for handling exception:\n\n    Respond to any exceptions you may find to the above rules based on business feasibility, but make sure that all exceptions are recorded as re-architecting points so that they can be revisited.\n\nThe trickiest part of these rules is the data categorization rules. For example, the tables in DATA MART are used for Products as they are, but you can join multiple mart tables to create a new table for analysis.\n\nYou can make the following judgments to deal with these cases.\n\n1. Consider whether other sources can be used to produce data for analytical purposes instead of using DATA MART tables as sources.\n\n2. You should be able to consider whether you can build a new DATA WAREHOUSE with DATA MART tables as its source for analytical purposes.\n\nDepending on your business situation, I'm sure there are other options to consider, but this is where data engineers grow from much experience and study.\n\n### 4. Plan how you will manage your data lineage.\nThe more complex your business logic becomes, the more likely you are to have a single point of failure due to the people who planned the data architecture in the first place, so you need to think about how to manage Data Lineage in a way that anyone can learn. If it's difficult for everyone to learn, you will end up with SPF.\n\nTo ensure that to configure Data Lineage in a way that doesn't hurt your productivity, we recommend avoiding the following situations as much as possible.\n\n1. If you must create a cyclic structure within one data warehouse.\n\n2. When processing data by referring to sources contained in different data stages\n\nBoth situations would undermine the definition of the data stages we planned in #3.\nThese problems are best solved by leveraging domain knowledge, business goals, and stakeholder communication because complex data lineage will eventually become a bottleneck for data productivity.\n\nThere are choices here that you should avoid at all costs.\n\n1. The solution of changing how data analysts or data backend engineers handle things:\n\n    This solution will eventually lead to you facing the same problem again.\n\n2. Choosing complexity because it is unavoidable and utilizing the resulting data as a source for subsequent data:\n\n    If you choose to allow exceptions because complexity is an inevitable feature of your structure, you must control that the exceptions allowed do not increase complexity downstream.\n\n### 5. Plan how you will validate, verify, and monitor your data.\nWe will always encounter unexpected exception data, even with good data architecture.\nThese exceptions can happen by complex logic that exceeds the scope of allocated resources, outlier inputs that don't have a business impact, or schema changes or version upgrades to the data source.\n\nData quality is more important to data engineers than anything else, so they must be the first to identify and respond to possible exceptions for all data-handling pipelines.\nSo, to complete a good data architecture, you need to decide how to organize your validation and verification and how to monitor it.\n\nHere's what I consider important about Validation, Verification, and Monitoring.\n\n1. You should be able to verify that it follows the definition of a Stage.\n\n2. Depending on the data lineage, you should ensure each validation logic that verifies data for a specific point. You should not perform validation of the same objective at multiple stages.\n\n3.  You should separately record exception data identified during the validation process and leverage it in the verification rule.\n\n4. You should monitor by identifying the points where the most exceptions occurred during development but should evolve through issues during production to avoid gray areas.\n\n## Conclusion\nThere isn't a right answer to good data architecture because better technologies are always introduced into the world, and more creative solutions can be found. While creating that answer, we should always be careful about what we must catch. What we achieve may not be the best, it may be the second best, but we can create another best if we aim for best practices and don't forget what we need to consider to do that.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-03T15:36:13.853775457Z","tags":null},"/notes/data_engineering/idea_for_good_data_warehousing_kr":{"title":"[DE] Idea for good Data Warehousing (KR)","content":"# Go to English Edition [Idea for good Data Warehousing (EN)](notes/data_engineering/idea_for_good_data_warehousing_en.md)\n\n# Idea for good Data Warehousing (KR)\n저는 좋은 데이터 엔지니어는 데이터 웨어하우스를 잘 관리할 수 있어야 한다고 생각합니다.\n왜냐하면, 비록 많은 사람들이 데이터 엔지니어가 해야 하는 영역이 너무 넓다고 말하지만, 그 중에서도 데이터를 저장하고 다루는 공간을 잘 구축하는 것이 가장 중요한 임무라고 생각하기 때문입니다.\n오늘은 데이터 웨어하우스를 구축하고 관리하면서 꼭 신경써야 한다고 생각하는 것들에 대해서 몇 가지 적어보았습니다.\n\n## 데이터 웨어하우스의 정의\n가장 먼저 데이터 웨어하우스의 정의부터 살펴봅니다.\n\n1992년 Inmon W.H의 책 (Building the Data Warehouse)에서 처음 소개된 데이터 웨어하우스란 회사의 운영 방향 대신 특정 주제에 맞는 데이터를 지니고 있으며 (Subject Oriented), 여러 가지 데이터 소스로부터 수집된 데이터들이 모이는 곳입니다 (Integrated). Inmon은 또한, 데이터 웨어하우스는 모든 데이터가 각각 특정 시간 구간에서 식별될 수 있어야 하며 (Time-variant), 데이터가 추가될 수 있으면서 지워지지 않아 일관된 목적을 유지할 수 있는 비휘발성 (Non-volatile)을 갖춰야 한다고 말합니다.\n\n저는 이것이 가장 일반적인 범위에서 정의된 데이터 웨어하우스이기 때문에 현 시대에 역할을 수행하는 데이터 웨어하우스들과는 분명히 차이가 존재한다고 생각합니다.\n현재의 데이터 웨어하우스에는 데이터의 목적과, 저장 및 처리 비용을 포함하는 다른 다양한 외부 요인들까지 포함하여 완성되기 때문입니다.\n\n저는 이 정의에 덧붙일 수 있는, 데이터 웨어하우스를 설계할 때 중요하게 고려해야 하는 것들을 몇 가지 이야기하려고 합니다.\n\n## 데이터 웨어하우스 설계를 위한 도메인 지식\n저는 데이터 엔지니어가 잘 갖춰진 논리에 근거해 데이터를 다뤄야 한다고 생각하기 때문에 도메인 지식은 굉장히 중요하다고 생각합니다.\n데이터 엔지니어가 데이터가 쓰이는 곳에 대한 배경지식이 없다면, 각각의 데이터가 가진 상관관계와 인과관계를 제대로 구분하지 못하게 됩니다. 이는 논리에 근거해 데이터를 다루는 것이 아니라 보기 좋게 꾸며진 데이터 가공이 되어 어떤 효용도 없게 만들 것입니다.\n저는 그렇기 때문에 데이터 엔지니어라면 도메인 지식을 잘 갖추고, 다뤄야 할 데이터들이 어떤 형태로 존재하는 지, 그리고 어떤 방향으로 쓰이는 지까지 전부 이해하려고 노력해야 한다고 생각합니다.\n\n도메인 주도 설계와 비슷한 관점으로 보일 수 있지만, 조금은 다른 점이 있다고 생각합니다.\n도메인 주도 설계를 채택하면 일반적으로 높은 생산성과 낮은 복잡도, 쉬운 커뮤니케이션을 달성할 수 있다고 잘 알려져 있습니다. 도메인 지식을 갖춘 데이터 웨어하우스는 데이터의 활용 범위를 가능한 한 최대로 유지할 수 있으면서, 현재 데이터 특성을 가장 잘 반영하면서 다양한 성능 최적화를 달성할 수 있습니다.\n\n\n## 데이터 웨어하우스 설계 과정에서의 수요 예측\n도메인 지식을 잘 이해한 데이터 엔지니어에게 또 하나 남은 과제가 있다면, 수요 예측이라고 생각합니다.\n수요 예측은 데이터 웨어하우스에서 소비자들이 분석 목적으로 자주 사용할 데이터의 수요를 예측하여 그 데이터를 사용하기 좋은 형태로 준비하는 과정을 의미합니다.\n\n데이터 프로덕트를 만드는 과정에서는 여러 가지 데이터 포인트로부터 인사이트를 도출해야 합니다. 데이터 엔지니어는 가장 데이터 소스와 밀접한 위치에서 일하는 사람이기 때문에, 이 데이터들에 가장 먼저 접근할 수 있고, 가장 기본적인 분석을 쉽게 해낼 수 있는 역할에 위치해 있습니다.\n대부분의 데이터는 다차원 데이터 형태를 갖고 있습니다. 같은 데이터라도 여러 차원으로 분리되어 분석에 사용될 수 있다는 의미입니다.\n다차원 데이터를 다룬다면, 그 속에서 여러 차원에 대한 분석을 통해 다양한 상관관계를 파악할 수 있어야 합니다.\n그렇지만 모든 상관관계가 유의미한 인과관계 분석으로 이어지지 않습니다. 그렇기 때문에 데이터 엔지니어는 자신이 만든 데이터를 사용하는 소비자와 많은 대화를 나눌 수 있어야 합니다.\n\n*대개 이 경우에 소비자는 데이터 분석가, 백엔드 엔지니어, 프로젝트 매니저, 프로덕트 매니저처럼 다양한 기능의 역할을 수행하는 사람들일 것입니다. 결국 이 모든 구성원은 같은 목적을 갖고 데이터를 다루는 사람들이라는 공통점이 있기 때문에, 잘 설정된 목표를 넓게 이해한 상태여야 하겠습니다.*\n\n이를 통해 데이터 파이프라인이 어떤 식으로 데이터를 저장하고, 업데이트 되어야 하는 지를 파악할 수 있어야 합니다.\n\n## 내가 데이터 웨어하우스 아키텍쳐를 만든다면,\n위에서 설명했듯이 데이터 엔지니어는 잘 갖춰진 도메인 지식을 바탕으로 가장 먼저 데이터의 전반적인 이해를 갖추고, 소비자의 수요를 이해한 다음에 이에 따라 데이터 웨어하우스 아키텍쳐를 설계할 수 있어야 한다고 생각합니다.\n이 과정을 세심하게 따르지 않는다면, 당신은 여러 가지 데이터 수요에 대응하거나, 수시로 데이터 스키마를 변경하는 작업을 진행하는 등의 데이터 웨어하우스 아키텍쳐 리팩토링을 하느라 귀한 시간을 소모하게 될 것이라고 생각합니다.\n\n이에 따라, 만일 제가 데이터 웨어하우스 아키텍쳐를 처음부터 설계한다면, 어떤 것들을 고려하고자 하는 지 아래에 적어보려고 합니다.\n\n### 1. 가능한 한 지금 주어진 데이터들에 대해 최대한 이해합니다.\n책상 위에 펼쳐진 데이터들을 충분히 이해하지 못한 상태에서 설계한 데이터 웨어하우스 아키텍쳐는 수명이 짧다고 생각합니다. 위에서 말한 것 처럼 보유한 데이터를 이해하고, 이 데이터의 소비자들과의 커뮤니케이션을 통해 달성해야 하는 목표를 이해할 시간이 꼭 필요합니다.\n\n### 2. 가장 먼저 달성해야 하는 목표와 그 목표를 달성할 방법을 확인합니다.\n저는 모든 데이터 아키텍쳐에는 비즈니스 타당성이 포함되어 있다고 생각합니다. 모든 가능성을 고려한 간결하고 유지보수하기 좋은 아키텍쳐는 현실에 존재하지 않습니다. 가장 먼저 달성해야 하는 목표를 달성할 수 있는 방법을 고려해야 합니다. 그리고 이 과정에서 최대한 쉽고 적은 비용의 테크 스펙과 구현 방식을 채택해야 합니다. 비즈니스 로직은 당연하게도 더 복잡해질 것이기 때문입니다.\n\n이 과정에서 제가 고려하고자 하는 것들은 아래와 같습니다.\n\n#### 소비자 관점에서의 요구사항:\n데이터 파이프라인의 결과물을 소비할 Data Analyst, Backend Engineer들과 커뮤니케이션을 통해 요구사항을 파악해야 합니다. 필수적으로 포함되어야 하는 정보와, 데이터 형식, 데이터 업데이트 주기에 대해서 합의가 이뤄져야 합니다. 그것은 SLA의 형태일 수도 있습니다. 다만, 이상적으로 완벽한 구현이 요구된다면, 비즈니스 타당성을 고려해 달성 가능한 목표를 세분화해서 일정을 산출하고 작업을 수행할 수 있어야 합니다.\n\n#### 테크 스펙 선정:\n구현을 위해서 테크 스펙을 선정해야 합니다. 이 때 고려해야 하는 것은,\n\n1. 데이터 인프라 아키텍쳐\n\n2. 데이터 인프라에 대한 팀원들의 기술 친화도\n\n3. 데이터 인프라에 대한 주/월 단위 비용 예측\n\n4. 구현에 필요한 시간 예측이 있습니다.\n\n등이 있습니다.\n\n모든 요소가 불확실성이 높으면서도 중요도의 순서를 결정하기 어렵다는 문제가 있습니다. 풀고자 하는 문제가 모든 회사의 모든 팀에서 각기 다른 모습을 하고 있기 때문입니다.\n\n저는 이런 상황에서는 가장 먼저 팀원들과 함께, Pre-Mortem을 진행해보는 것도 좋은 방법이 될 수 있다고 생각합니다.\n대니얼 카너먼은 책 '생각에 관한 생각'에서 계획 오류라는 개념을 언급하며, 많은 사람들이 과신에 빠진 나머지 계획을 세울 때, 비현실적으로 최상의 시나리오를 짜거나, 비슷한 다른 상황의 사례를 찾아보는 외부 관점을 무시해 계획을 수행하는 것에 실패한다고 말합니다.\n저는 이런 문제를 해결하기 위해, Pre-Mortem을 아래와 같이 진행해볼 수 있다고 생각합니다. 그는 원인이 되는 지나친 낙관주의를 해결하기 위해, Pre-Mortem을 제안합니다. 이 개념을 우리 문제에 적용해보면, 아래와 같이 진행해볼 수 있다고 생각합니다.\n\n1. 팀원들과 모여서 1,3,6개월 뒤에 이 테크 스펙이 참담하게 실패하는 이유들을 각자 적어본다.\n\n2. 각 실패 이유들에 대해 계획 과정에서 예방할 방법을 확인한다.\n\n3. 각 실패 이유들을 해결한 외부 사례를 간단히 탐색한다.\n\n이렇게 되면, 해당 팀이 집단적으로 결정에 순응하는 것을 방지할 수 있으며, 박식한 사람들이 바람직한 방향으로 상상력을 펼쳐내 위험 요소를 파악해볼 수 있다는 장점이 있습니다.\n이 과정을 거친 다음에, 다시 위의 4가지 고려사항을 최대한 만족하는 테크 스펙을 선정한다면, 훨씬 신뢰도 높은 테크 스펙을 선정할 수 있을 것이라고 생각합니다.\n\n### 3. 데이터 Stage를 계획합니다.\n각 Stage별 실행되는 ETL 작업의 목적을 정의하고, 결과 데이터의 역할을 정의하는 과정이 필요합니다.\n\n예를 들어 data source를 적재하는 data lake와, 가공된 데이터들이 포함되는 data warehouse, 실제 product 또는 분석에 사용될 data mart로 stage를 구분해 계획하는 방법이 있습니다. 각 stage에서 데이터를 처리하는 pipe의 역할이 명확할수록 추후에 구조 개선을 할 때에 개선 지점을 파악하기 좋을 것이라고 생각합니다.\n\n기본적으로 세운 원칙은 아래와 같습니다.\n\n1. 데이터 저장 규칙:\n\n    각 stage는 데이터 저장 규칙을 명확하게 정해야 합니다. 이를테면, 모든 stage가 non-volatile할 필요는 없지만, Source는 Non-volatile을 꼭 지켜야 한다는 규칙을 세울 수 있습니다.\n\n2. 데이터 분류 규칙:\n\n    각 stage의 데이터 분류 규칙을 명확하게 정해야 합니다. 이를테면, data mart의 데이터 성격은 여러 개의 data source를 통해 새로운 정보가 생성된 데이터일 수도 있고, pipeline 외부의 사용처가 명확히 정해진 데이터일 수도 있습니다. 성격을 명확하게 분류하지 않아 data mart에 포함되어야 할 데이터가 다른 stage에 포함되지 않는 문제가 발생하지 않도록 해야 합니다.\n\n3. 데이터 가공 규칙:\n\n    각 stage의 데이터 가공 규칙을 명확하게 정해야 합니다. 이를테면, data mart 이전의 stage의 데이터를 다루는 pipeline은 멱등성을 보장하는 로직을 강제할 수 있습니다. 또는, data lake의 데이터를 가공할 때에는 데이터 타입 변경, 칼럼 이름 변경 등만 허용하는 규칙을 강제할 수 있습니다.\n\n4. 예외 처리 규칙:\n\n    a,b,c에 관한 예외는 비즈니스 타당성에 맞게 대응하되 모든 예외 사항은 re-architecturing point로 기록해 revisit 가능하게 해야 합니다.\n\n이 규칙들 중에서 가장 까다로운 지점은 데이터 분류 규칙이라고 생각합니다. 예를 들어 data mart의 테이블들은 그대로 Product에 사용되기도 하지만, mart 테이블 여러 개를 join해서 새로운 테이블로 만들어 분석에 활용할 수 있다고 생각합니다.\n이러한 경우에 대응하기 위해서 우리는 다음과 같은 판단을 할 수 있다고 생각합니다.\n\n1. source들을 최대한 활용하여 분석 목적 용도로 사용할 데이터를 생산 가능한 지를 고려해볼 수 있어야 합니다.\n\n2. 분석 목적으로 사용할 data mart 테이블을 source로 하는 분석 목적의 data warehouse를 새롭게 구축할 수 있는 지 고려해볼 수 있어야 합니다.\n\n이 외에도 비즈니스 상황에 따라 다른 고려할 수 있는 옵션들이 있겠습니다. 많은 경험과 공부를 통해 데이터 엔지니어가 성장하는 지점이라고 생각합니다.\n\n### 4. 데이터 Lineage 관리 방법을 계획합니다.\n비즈니스 로직이 복잡해질수록, 최초에 데이터 아키텍쳐를 계획한 작업자들으로 인해 single point of failure가 발생할 확률이 높아진다고 생각합니다. 따라서 누구나 학습할 수 있는 Lineage 관리 방법을 고민해야 합니다. 누구나 학습하기에는 어려운 구조라고 생각이 들었다면, 결국 이는 SPF를 발생시키게 될 것입니다.\n\n데이터 Lineage가 생산성을 해치지 않는 선에서 구성되려면 아래의 상황은 최대한 피하는 것이 좋다고 생각합니다.\n\n1. 한 data warehouse 내에서 cyclic 구조가 생겨야 하는 경우\n\n2. 서로 다른 data stage에 포함된 source를 참조해 데이터를 가공하는 경우\n\n위 두 가지 상황은 3번에서 계획한 데이터 stage의 정의를 해치게 됩니다.\n이러한 문제들은 도메인 지식과 비즈니스 목표, 이해당사자들과의 커뮤니케이션을 잘 활용해 문제를 해결해야 한다고 생각합니다.\n복잡도가 높은 데이터 lineage는 결국 나중에 데이터 생산성의 병목 요인이 될 것이기 때문입니다.\n\n저는 여기에서 꼭 피해야 하는 선택들이 있다고 생각합니다.\n\n1. 데이터 분석가 또는 데이터 백엔드 엔지니어의 처리 방식을 변경하는 해결책:\n\n    이 해결책은 결국 다시 같은 문제를 직면하게 할 것입니다.\n\n2. 불가피하게 복잡도를 선택한 경우에, 해당 선택의 결과 데이터를 이후 데이터의 source로 활용하는 경우:\n\n    복잡도를 피할 수 없는 구조라는 이유로 예외 허용을 택했다면, 허용된 예외가 downstream에서 복잡도를 높이지 못하게 통제해야 합니다.\n\n### 5. 데이터 Validation, Verification \u0026 Monitoring 방법을 구상합니다.\n좋은 데이터 아키텍쳐를 설계했다고 하더라도, 늘 우리는 예상치 못한 예외 데이터를 마주해야 합니다.\n이러한 예외는 할당된 리소스 범위를 초과하는 복잡한 로직 때문에 발생할 수도 있고, 비즈니스 임팩트를 주지 못하는 outlier에 해당하는 Input으로 인해 발생할 수도 있으며, 데이터 source의 스키마 변경 또는 버전 업그레이드로 인해 발생할 수도 있습니다.\n\n데이터 엔지니어에게 어떤 것보다 중요한 것은 데이터 퀄리티라고 생각합니다. 그렇기 때문에 데이터 엔지니어는 모든 데이터를 다루는 파이프라인들에 대해서 가능한 예외를 가장 먼저 파악하고 대응할 수 있어야 합니다.\n따라서 좋은 데이터 아키텍쳐를 완성하기 위해서는 Validation과 Verification을 어떻게 구성할 지, 그리고 이를 어떻게 Monitoring할 지 결정해야 합니다.\n\n제가 Validation / Verification에 대해서 중요하게 생각하는 것은 아래와 같습니다.\n\n1.

Overview\n\n![Screenshot](/notes/dune_nft/images/market_overview/01_overview.png)\n\nYou can see that we have constructed a pie chart using **Volume / Number of trades / Number of traders**.\n\nGiven that the amount of data is large by default, and that more recent data is more meaningful for trading, they show the most recent 1-week data.\nThe trade column in the **NFT Collection Ranked by Volume** chart below are links to actual tradeable websites, so they don't mean much.\n\n### 2. Volume\n\n![Screenshot](/notes/dune_nft/images/market_overview/02_volume.png)\n\nTrading volume is organized into Bar Chart and Stacked Area Chart, each of which allows you to view Daily Volume and Weekly Volume.\n\nThe Bar Chart is a great way to see total volume, so you can see overall volume trends and time series of marketplace share.\nThe Stacked Area Chart is an intuitive representation of the share seen in this Bar Chart.\n\n\n\n### 3. Transactions\n\n![Screenshot](/notes/dune_nft/images/market_overview/03_transactions.png)\n\nThe transactions chart is organized the same as the volume chart, with the numbers in each chart representing the number of transactions.\n\nIf you compare the number of trades chart to the volume chart, you can see that Blur's volume has recently spiked and surpassed Opensea's volume, but that hasn't translated to the number of trades. We can assume that there are still a lot of active users on Opensea.\n\n### 4. Traders\n\n![Screenshot](/notes/dune_nft/images/market_overview/04_traders.png)\n\nThis chart shows the number of wallets that have traded NFTs.\n\nIn this case, They used a Line Chart instead of a Stacked Area Chart. I thought it's better to use a Stacked Area Chart, so I made Stacked Area Chart for comparison\n\n![Screenshot](/notes/dune_nft/images/market_overview/04_1_traders_area.png)\n\nI was able to see these results, and there are a few takeaways from this comparison.\n\n1. Stacked Area Chart has the advantage of visualizing occupancy rates.\n2. Line charts allow you to visualize the share, but also to see how the value changes over time. For example, you can observe a sharp drop in the number of traders in March.\n3. However, the Traders chart is different from the other charts in that the Bar Chart counts the number of trading wallets by date, while the Line Chart counts the number of trading wallets by marketplace. Since there may be wallets that use multiple marketplaces at the same time, it is important to keep this in mind when organizing the chart.\n\n![Screenshot](/notes/dune_nft/images/market_overview/04_2_traders_area_2.png)\nIf you compare the screenshot above with the Bar Chart in the Dashboard, you can see that the values on the y-axis are different.\n\n### 5. Token Standards\n\n![Screenshot](/notes/dune_nft/images/market_overview/05_token_standards.png)\n\nThese Charts show Volume, Trade Count, and Trader Count by Token Standard.\n\nThis is where the question arose.\nIn the case of ERC721, you can only trade one token per token id, whereas ERC1155 allows you to trade multiple.\nAlso, Opensea allows bundle trade, so I was wondering how to calculate the price of nfts in these situation.\n\nSo I looked into Dune Spellbook. [링크](https://dune.com/spellbook#!/model/model.spellbook.seaport_v2_ethereum_trades)\n![Screenshot](/notes/dune_nft/images/market_overview/06_spellbook_opensea.png)\n\nAs you can see in the screenshot above, if multiple NFTs were traded in a particular trade, we were able to categorize it as a bundle trade and then split the trade price equally.\nThis tells us the following:\n\n- The opensea trades included in the nft trades dataset used by Dune are calculated by dividing the total price of the individual purchases of nft in a trade by the number of nft in the trade.\n- As a result, some transaction value data was calculated incorrectly.\n- However, in bundle transactions, the seller estimates the individual prices of the NFTs in the bundle and sells them together, and the same applies to the buyer, so there is no problem with using this data unless there is an accounting requirement for both the seller and buyer.\n\n## Further Study\n\nWhile researching Spellbook, something occurred to me that I wanted to investigate further.\nI've seen that it's difficult to estimate the exact purchase price for bundle transactions on Opensea.\nI want to see how Dune Analytics estimate the purchase price for transactions from market aggregators like Gem and Blur that sweep listings from multiple marketplaces\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-03T15:36:13.865775569Z","tags":null},"/notes/dune_nft/market_overview_kr":{"title":"[Dune] NFT Market Overview Chart Review (KR)","content":"\n\n## Market Overview 차트 리뷰\n작성 일자 : 2023년 3월 22일\n\n[NFT Market Overview](https://dune.com/hildobby/NFTs)를 리뷰해봤습니다.\n\n### 1. Overview\n\n![Screenshot](/notes/dune_nft/images/market_overview/01_overview.png)\n\n**거래량 / 거래 횟수 / 거래자 수**를 이용해 파이차트를 구성한 것을 확인할 수 있습니다.\n\n데이터 양이 기본적으로 많고, 최신 데이터가 Trading에 좀 더 유의미하다는 점을 감안해, 최근 1주 데이터를 보여줍니다.\n하단 **NFT Collection Ranked by Volume** 차트의 Trade는 실제 trade 가능한 웹사이트의 링크라서 큰 의미는 없습니다.\n\n### 2. Volume\n\n![Screenshot](/notes/dune_nft/images/market_overview/02_volume.png)\n\n거래량은 Bar Chart와 Stacked Area Chart로 구성되어 있고, 각각은 Daily Volume과 Weekly Volume을 볼 수 있습니다.\n\nBar Chart는 거래량 총합을 확인할 수 있다는 점에서 전반적인 거래량 추이와 시계열로 Marketplace 별 점유율을 가늠할 수 있습니다.\nStacked Area Chart는 이 Bar Chart에서 확인한 점유율을 직관적으로 표현한 것입니다.\n\n### 3. Transactions\n\n![Screenshot](/notes/dune_nft/images/market_overview/03_transactions.png)\n\n거래 횟수는 거래량 차트와 동일하게 구성되어 있고, 각 차트의 수치는 거래 횟수를 의미합니다.\n\n거래 횟수 차트를 거래량 차트와 비교해서 보면, 최근 Blur의 거래량이 급등해 Opensea의 거래량을 크게 넘어섰지만, 그것이 거래 횟수까지 이어지지는 않은 것을 알 수 있습니다. 아직 Opensea의 활성화 유저가 많이 남아있음을 추측할 수 있습니다.\n\n### 4. Traders\n\n![Screenshot](/notes/dune_nft/images/market_overview/04_traders.png)\n\n이 Chart는 NFT를 거래한 지갑의 수 추이를 보여줍니다.\n\n이 경우에는 Stacked Area Chart 대신, Line Chart를 사용했는데, Stacked Area Chart를 사용하는 것이 더 좋다는 생각이 들어 비교해 보고자 직접 Chart를 작성해 봤습니다.\n\n![Screenshot](/notes/dune_nft/images/market_overview/04_1_traders_area.png)\n\n이러한 결과를 볼 수 있었는데, 이 차트와 기존 차트를 비교해 보고 몇 가지 takeaway를 얻을 수 있었습니다.\n1. Stacked Area Chart를 사용하면 점유율을 시각화 하는 것에 장점이 있다.\n2. Line Chart를 사용하면 점유율을 시각화하는 동시에, 시계열에 따른 값 변화 차이를 잘 볼 수 있다. 예를 들어, 3월에 급격히 거래자 수가 급감한 시기를 관찰하는 것이 가능하다.\n3. 다만 Traders 차트는 다른 차트와 달리 주의할 점이 있었는데, Bar Chart의 경우는 날짜별 거래 지갑 수를 센 반면, Line Chart에서는 Marketplace 별로 거래 지갑 수를 세고 있다. 여러 Marketplace를 동시에 이용한 지갑이 존재할 수 있기 때문에, 차트 구성 시 유의하면 좋다.\n\n![Screenshot](/notes/dune_nft/images/market_overview/04_2_traders_area_2.png)\n위 스크린샷과 Dashboard의 Bar Chart를 비교해보면 y축의 값이 다른 것을 알 수 있습니다.\n\n### 5. Token Standards\n\n![Screenshot](/notes/dune_nft/images/market_overview/05_token_standards.png)\n\nToken Standard 별로 Volume, Trade Count, Trader Count를 표기한 것입니다.\n\n여기에서 궁금증이 생겼습니다.\nEERC721의 경우에는 token id 별로 1개만 거래 가능한 데에 반해, ERC1155는 여러 개를 거래할 수 있습니다.RC721의 경우에는 1개만 거래하는 데에 반해, ERC1155는 여러개를 거래할 수 있습니다.\n더불어, Opensea의 경우, Bundle 거래가 가능해 그 거래 Volume을 어떻게 잡는 지 궁금했습니다.\n\n그래서 Spellbook을 조사해봤습니다. [링크](https://dune.com/spellbook#!/model/model.spellbook.seaport_v2_ethereum_trades)\n![Screenshot](/notes/dune_nft/images/market_overview/06_spellbook_opensea.png)\n\n위 스크린샷에서 볼 수 있듯이, 특정 거래에서 nft가 여러 개 거래되는 경우에는 bundle 거래로 분류한 다음, 거래 대금을 균등하게 나누는 것을 확인할 수 있었습니다.\n이를 통해 다음과 같은 사실을 알 수 있습니다.\n\n- Dune에서 사용하는 nft trades dataset에 포함된 opensea 거래는 한 거래에 포함된 nft들의 개별 구매 대금을 전체 대금에서 거래에 포함된 nft의 개수로 나눠서 계산한다.\n- 따라서, 일부 거래 대금 데이터는 부정확하게 계산되었다.\n- 다만, 실제로도 Bundle 거래가 일어날 경우에는 판매자 역시 Bundle에 포함된 NFT들의 개별 가격을 추정한 다음 합산해서 판매하고, 이는 구매자 입장에서도 동일하게 적용되기 때문에, 실제 판매자와 구매자 입장에서는 회계 처리가 필요한 상황이 아니라면 본 데이터를 사용하는 것에 큰 문제가 없다.\n\n## Further Study\n\nSpellbook을 조사하는 과정에서 좀 더 조사하고 싶은 것이 생겼습니다.\nOpensea에서 발생한 Bundle 거래는 정확한 구매 대금을 추정하기 어렵다는 사실은 확인했는데,\nGem, Blur와 같은 Market Aggregator에서 여러 Marketplace의 Listing을 Sweep하는 거래의 경우는 어떻게 구매 대금을 산정하는 지 확인해보려고 합니다.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-03T15:36:13.865775569Z","tags":null},"/private/study/algorithm":{"title":"Algorithm","content":"\n\n## 이진탐색 문제\n- 구해야 하는 값과, 그 값에 따라 정해지는 변수 값들에 대한 최적화가 필요할 때 방정식 또는 부등식의 형태로 정의할 수 있는 문제는 이진 탐색으로 해결합니다.\n- 가장 대표적인 문제는 대기열에 서있는 n명의 사람들과 이 대기열을 소화할 수 있는 각기 다른 처리 시간을 가진 처리기 집합을 놓고, 처리 가능한 최소 시간을 구하는 문제입니다.\n- 이 경우에는 최소 시간을 목적값으로 하고, 이 최소 시간에 따라 각 처리기가 처리하는 사람의 수를 역으로 찾는 과정에서 효율적인 처리를 위해 최소 시간이 가질 수 있는 최대 값에서부터 이진 탐색으로 최소 시간을 추정하는 방식으로 알고리즘을 해결해야 합니다.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-03T15:36:13.865775569Z","tags":null},"/private/study/data_engineering":{"title":"Airflow","content":"\n\n## Airflow on Kubernetes 배포하기 (on M1 Mac)\n- m1에 minikube 설치하기 [참조](https://velog.io/@pinion7/macOs-m1-%ED%99%98%EA%B2%BD%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C-kubernetes-%EC%8B%9C%EC%9E%91%ED%95%98%EA%B8%B0)\n    ```shell\n    $ curl -Lo minikube https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/download/v1.25.1/minikube-darwin-arm64 \\\n  \u0026\u0026 chmod +x minikube\n    ```\n    ```shell\n    $ sudo install minikube /usr/local/bin/minikube\n    ```\n- heml, kubectl 설치하기\n    ```shell\n    $ brew install helm, kubectl\n    ```\n- minikube 시작\n    ```shell\n    $ minikube start --driver=docker\n    ```\n- helm repo 추가\n    ```shell\n    $ helm repo add apache-airflow https://airflow.apache.org\n    $ helm repo update\n    ```\n- airflow chart 설치\n    ```shell\n    $ helm install $RELEASE_NAME apache-airflow/airflow --namespace $NAMESPACE --debug\n    ```\n- webserver port-forwarding\n    ```shell\n    $ kubectl port-forward svc/airflow-webserver 8080:8080 --namespace $NAMESPACE\n    ```\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-03T15:36:13.865775569Z","tags":null},"/private/study/sql":{"title":"SQL","content":"\n\n## Rollup Query\n- 사용 방법: SUM(COLUMN_2) ...
